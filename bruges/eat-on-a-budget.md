Great food without burning all your holiday budget? Go to one of these place! They are my favourite!

[Lâ€™estaminet](http://www.estaminet-brugge.be/en/): My all time favourite, this bar combines great old interior with good beers and good food. I almost always eat the spaghetti here! But, don't ask a fork

[Lokkedize](https://foursquare.com/v/lokkedize/4ba3cc14f964a520766038e3): Well known for their delicious pitta, this is the perfect restaurant to enjoy food and drinks.

[De Stoepa](https://www.stoepa.be/nl/): Ready for wraps, falafel, pasta or wok, go and enjoy in De Stoepa! But don't forget to book!

[Frituur De Gentpoorte](https://foursquare.com/v/frituur-de-gentpoorte/5138e7e1e4b0922773e94e44): A "frituur" is a place where you can get fries and fried snacks. You can find them all over the place in Belgium (and also North-France or the Netherlands). Frituur De Gentpoorte is absolutely my favourite in Bruges. Big portions, nice fries and not so expensive!
