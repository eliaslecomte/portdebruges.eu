A brief explanation on how to get into Bruges without taxi.

# Brussels Airport (Brussel)

The biggest airport in Belgium, [Brussels Airport](https://www.brusselsairport.be) is very well connected by national railroad company [Nmbs](https://www.belgiantrain.be).

To find the schedule, use Brussels Airport – Zaventem as start point and going to Brugge. Direct trains take about 1h30. In addition to a single journey ticket costing € 21.30 (august 2017), you also have to by a additional ticket for stepping up or off at the airport (called diabolo toeslag) which costs € 5.25 (augustus 2017).

People under 26 get a discounted price by buying a Go Pass 1. This ticket that costs € 6.20 allows you to travel from-to any location in Belgium by train for the same price. You still have to buy the diabolo ticket though.

You can buy a ticket at a vending machine, a booth or via the [Nmbs app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.sncbnmbs) (supports credit card).

# Brussels South Charleroi Airport (Charleroi)

Brussels South Airport, or Charleroi Airport, a popular destination due to Ryan Air, is pretty far away from Brussels or Bruges. It’s also bad connected with public transport.

The easiest way is to come and go by [Flibco](https://www.flibco.com) bus. Prices vary by when you travel, and start around € 15 for a return trip.

# Aéroport de Lille (Lille)

Lille Airport is also well connected to cities like Porto or Marseille. Before, you had to travel by public train to Bruges, but as like from Charleroi Airport, you can now also take a quicker and cheaper bus: [Flixbus](https://flixbus.com). You’ll also have to take a a shuttle from the Airport to Lille.
