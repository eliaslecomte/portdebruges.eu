title: My favourite brown bars in Bruges
---
When in Bruges, I definitely recommend one of my favourite brown bars! The perfect place to take a moment and relax when sipping a cold Belgian beer.

[L'estaminet](https://foursquare.com/v/lestaminet/4bcae7c268f976b061226083): Great pub that serves delicious Spaghetti.

[Joey's Cafe](https://foursquare.com/v/joeys-cafe/4c6a963d1a6620a1e86c668c): Classic brown bar where they often play blues music.

[Café Vlissinghe](https://foursquare.com/v/caf%C3%A9-vlissinghe/4bb7263def159c746dd976f7): The oldest still open inn in Bruges. Authentic interior, worth a visit.

[De Vetten Os](https://foursquare.com/v/de-vetten-os/4c65bb30aebea593e73d71d0): This relaxed bar often transforms when hosting live music or playing party music.

[Le Trappiste](https://foursquare.com/v/le-trappiste/516084c2f31cd21c78917ad0): Part of a new chain, but situated in an old cellar. They have quite a range of beers on tap!
