When you're tired of being amazed by the beautiful buildings outside, it's time to ascend the stairs and enter the charm of one of the many cellar bars!

Enjoy the moment and let it take you back in time!

[The Druid's Cellar](https://foursquare.com/v/the-druids-cellar/4d836a6881fdb1f7d437e6bf): A real gem, this beautiful pub is. It features many candles, heavy wooden tables, a trumpet toilet, a pool table. Definitely worth some of your time.

['t Poatersgat](https://foursquare.com/v/t-poatersgat/4b805d78f964a520bf6b30e3): A famous bar in Bruges always full of people, be it locals or tourists. They serve a huge selection of beers, my favourites are their [geuze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gueuze).

[Comptoir Des Arts](https://foursquare.com/v/comptoir-des-arts/4c421033d7fad13ab78b08da): Once called the Attic, now, Comptoir Des Arts is a trendy place where art is displayed of local artists.
