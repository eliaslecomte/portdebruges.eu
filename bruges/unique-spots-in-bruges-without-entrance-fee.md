You can visit the remains of the St. Donatian Church, that used to stood on the Burg from 900 till 1799 when Napoleon ripped it down. Nowadays, the Crowne Plaza Hotel is built on top of it. They have converted it into a conference and reception room, but when none is happening, tourists are allowed to discover it. Just enter the hotel and ask the reception. They will show you to the entrance, when it is available.

In the Rozenhoedkaai street, you have one of the most astonishing views of Bruges, specially at night when the old buildings are in the spotlight.

Very quiet and famous is our Béguinage. In my opinion, the prettiest! A béguinage is an architectural complex which was created to house beguines: lay religious women who lived in community without taking vows or retiring from the world.

This is the perfect spot to relax on a bench and enjoy the pretty flowers, the old trees, the old houses and church.

Behind the Oud Sint-Jans hospital, the herbs garden is situated. The hospital itself is great. Walking around, many historical buildings are situated. But I enjoy the garden the most, as it is so peaceful and quiet.

Small streets? Of course! The “Stoofstraat” is my famous, a long and narrow street, usually full of tourists. The “De Garre” street is another must see. Almost so small you could easily miss it! At the end of this street, there is the famous [De Garre](https://foursquare.com/v/de-garre/4c3de51c933b0f475802e621) bar where they serve their own beer, also named De Garre.
